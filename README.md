# Tigers Kycklingstuds

## What is this?

This is a re-implementation of the glorious game [Tigers Kycklingstuds](http://speldemo.extrude.se/tigerstuds/spel.html).

The game is based on decompiled files from the original Flash game, made by [Extrude Interactive](http://extrude.se).
Do note that my re-implementation is not an exact 1:1 with the original game, as I had to change some things. It does
play more or less like the old game though.

You can play the game here: [optimuscrime.github.io/tigers-kycklingstuds](https://optimuscrime.github.io/tigers-kycklingstuds).
